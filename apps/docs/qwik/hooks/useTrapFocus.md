# useTrapFocus

:::::: slot usage

`useTrapFocus` allows you to trap focus inside a specific DOM element. Focus traps are especially useful for modals, dropdown menus, and other elements that should keep focus within the element when it is open.

This is a great way to improve the accessibility of your application because with focus traps, you can ensure that users navigating your site using only a keyboard won't accidentally interact with elements outside the focus trap.

Under the hood, this composable uses `focus-trap/tabbable`. To learn more about their specific implementation and see the rules used to gather focusable elements visit the [tabbable docs](https://github.com/focus-trap/tabbable).

## Usage

### Base Usage

To use `useTrapFocus`, we can use a template ref to identify the element that we want to trap focus inside of. Then, we can pass that ref to `useTrapFocus` and whenever that element is being rendered, the focus trap will be active.

<SourceCode>

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
import { ref } from 'vue';
import { useTrapFocus } from '@storefront-ui/vue';

const focusTrapElementRef = ref<HTMLDivElement>();
useTrapFocus(focusTrapElementRef)
</script>

<template>
  <div ref="focusTrapElementRef">
    This container has <a href="#">Focusable anchor</a> and another <button>Focusable button</button> or <span class="focus:outline" tabindex="0">Focusable span</span>
  </div>
</template>
```
</SourceCode>
